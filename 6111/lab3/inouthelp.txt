Gary Cook (BNR Europe) suggested the following:
    module mema (r_wb,addr,d_q);
    input r_wb; input [7:0] addr;
    inout [7:0] d_q;
    reg [7:0] data [0:255];
    assign d_q = (r_wb) ? data[addr] : 8'hz ;
    always @(r_wb)
        if (!r_wb) data[addr] = d_q ;
    always @(addr)
        if (!r_wb) data[addr] = d_q ;
    endmodule  

The assign puts the stored 'data' onto the d_q bus when r_wb is high, ie indicat ing a read. When d_q is low , the assign tri-states the d_q which can be driven by the driving device.

[Ed. note: This solution has several potential gotchas. What does this model do if addr and r_wb change at the same time?]
