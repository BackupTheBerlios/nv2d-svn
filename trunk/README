Testing:

The ANT build file supports Clover (http://www.cenqua.com/clover/) coverage
utility.  To take advantage of the Clover coverage facilities, do the
following:

1. Add lib/clover.jar to your ANT_HOME directory (under unix systems, this
   can be '~/.ant/lib').  You must have a license.  Open Source developers
   can apply for a free license.
2. Run 'ant with.clover build'
3. Run 'ant with.clover nv2d' and perform coverage tests.
4. Run 'ant with.clover clover.html' to generate the coverage report.
